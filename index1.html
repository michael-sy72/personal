        <p>My interest in IT started because of my passion with latest gadgets such as mobile device and wearables. Perhaps my current job in telecom open up my curiosity even further. IT is the future as well as it is very much needed today. During the first hit of pandemic it made me realized how important IT is to the world from home learning / working from home to the needed technology used for tracing cases and whole IT needs in dealing with this situations. </p>

        <p>I love to travel. But with this current situation this passion has been set aside. But with the vaccination coming full force around the world, there might be a ray of hope for travellers. My project idea is to create a worldwide accredited apps / program that will certify a user if he is fully vaccinated. A program that will link the userâ€™s real vaccination information to get the accreditation for validity that can be used and endorsed globally.
